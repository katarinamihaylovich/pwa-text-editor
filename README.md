# pwa-text-editor

## Description

The purpose of this project what to create a simple text editing app so that a user would be able to write plain text or code with or without an internet connection. It is a single page app that uses service workers which run independently and in between the browser and the application. When a user opens the deployed app via Heroku, they are presented with the application and an "install" button which, when clicked, allows the user to download the app to their desktop. From there, the user is able to update the editor and have all their changes saved even when the app is closed. To accomplish all of this, I used an API called IndexedDB, webpack, manifest.json, cacheing, and pre-written code. What I learned most was the details of what progressive web apps are, how to do cache storing, and how client and server side parts of an app interact. 

## Technology Used:
1. Javascript
